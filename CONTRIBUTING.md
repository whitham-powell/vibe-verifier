3. **Provide details**:
   - What you were trying to do
   - What actually happened
   - Error messages (if any)
   - Your environment (OS, Python version)
   - Steps to reproduce

Example issue template:
```markdown
**Description**: Brief description of the issue

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Run `vibe-verifier /path/to/repo`
2. Observe error in output
3. ...

**Expected Behavior**: What should happen

**Actual Behavior**: What actually happened

**Environment**:
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Python: 3.10.5
- Vibe Verifier version: 0.1.0
```

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vibes/vibe-verifier.git
   cd vibe-verifier
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/vibes/vibe-verifier.git
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   # Using uv (recommended - much faster!)
   ./scripts/setup-dev-uv.sh
   
   # Or using pip
   ./scripts/setup-dev.sh
   ```

4. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Follow the "trust but verify" philosophy

5. **Run tests and checks**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   make test
   
   # Run linting
   make lint
   
   # Format code
   make format
   ```

6. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   # Use conventional commit format
   git commit -m "feat: add support for Ruby language detection"
   git commit -m "fix: handle empty test directories gracefully"
   git commit -m "docs: update contributing guidelines"
   ```

7. **Push and create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then create a pull request on GitHub with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Link to related issues
   - Screenshots/examples if applicable

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use type hints for all functions
- Write docstrings for public functions
- Keep functions focused and testable

### Testing Philosophy

Remember our core principle: **trust but verify**. When adding features:

1. **Never trust inputs** - validate everything
2. **Write tests first** when possible
3. **Test edge cases** thoroughly
4. **Mock external dependencies** in unit tests

### Adding New Language Support

To add support for a new programming language:

1. Update `LanguageDetector` in `src/analyzers/complexity.py`
2. Add test framework detection in `src/testers/test_runner.py`
3. Add verification tools in `src/verifiers/formal_verifier.py`
4. Include example projects in tests
5. Update documentation

### Commit Message Format

We use conventional commits:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions or changes
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

## Areas We Need Help

### High Priority

1. **Language Support**
   - Swift, Kotlin, Scala support
   - Better C++ analysis
   - Framework-specific analysis (React, Django, etc.)

2. **Verification Tools**
   - Integration with more formal verification tools
   - Improved security scanning
   - Performance profiling

3. **Testing**
   - More test cases for edge scenarios
   - Cross-platform testing
   - Large repository performance testing

### Documentation

- Usage examples for different scenarios
- Video tutorials
- Translation to other languages
- Architecture deep-dives

### Infrastructure

- CI/CD improvements
- Docker support
- Package distribution (Homebrew, AUR, etc.)
- Performance optimizations

## For AI Agent Contributors

We welcome contributions from AI agents! When contributing:

1. **Clearly identify** that you're an AI agent in PRs/issues
2. **Provide context** about your analysis or changes
3. **Include verification steps** for your contributions
4. **Follow the same guidelines** as human contributors

Example AI agent PR description:
```markdown
This PR was generated by [AI Agent Name].

**Analysis**: Detected missing error handling in test_runner.py
**Solution**: Added try-except blocks with appropriate error messages
**Verification**: Run `pytest tests/test_test_runner.py` to verify fixes
```
